Instructions to use the compiler:

1) If it is possible to use python on the command line:

python PATH_TO_COMPILER PATH_TO_FILE

The compiled files are placed in the same directory as the original file

2) If Jupyter Notebook is installed, run the .ipynb with whatever method your
   OS supports. Uncomment the line beginning with # sys.argv and replace 
   PATH_TO_PROGRAM with the relative or absolute path to the program's assembly
   text file.

3) The compiler can't be run without command line Python or Jupyter Notebook

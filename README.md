# Emulator Files
This emulator was created to solidify the fec encoder/decoder and bit pattern searching algorithms. Inside the arch_emulator folder you will find two C programs:
  
  program1.c (fec encoder/decoder)
  
    - requires program1_2_results.txt(console output from SystemVerilog fec encoder/decoder)  
  
  program3.c (bit pattern search)
  
    - requires program3results.txt(console output from SystemVerilog bit pattern search)
